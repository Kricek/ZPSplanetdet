Section 5.1, p.15
For events with multiple degenerate models that fit the data,
we weight the different models with exp(-Δχ2 / 2), where Δχ2 is the
χ2 difference between the model in question and the best-fit
model. Mostly, these degenerate models are close and wide
models, but we also use a similar procedure for our ambiguous
planetary event OGLE-2011-BLG-0950/MOA-2011-BLG-336,
as discussed in Section 3.3.

Section 3.3, p. 9
The probability that this ambiguous event is due to a
planetary system rather than a stellar binary depends both on
the χ2 values for the respective fits and the prior probabilities of
lens systems with the parameters of the best-fit models. We
define the relative fit probability of the stellar binary model to
be exp(-Δχ2 / T), where T = 2 is the correct value if the observa-
tional uncertainties follow an uncorrelated Gaussian distribution.
When T = 2, this is equivalent to the likelihood
ratio that is sometimes used for similar model comparisons
(Bozza et al. 2016). We can adjust T in order to test the effects
of non-Gaussian uncertainties.
